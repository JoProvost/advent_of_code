My solutions to Advent of Code 2017
===================================

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety
> of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate
> for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who
> is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and
> has two parts that build on a theme.
